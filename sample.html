			<p><em>One of bitcoin's earliest angel investors, <span class="il">Roger</span> Ver has backed a number of startups including BitPay, Purse and ShapeShift, and is the owner of resource portal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=https://www.bitcoin.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491340262472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHS2-KAswT6HhTn9JXt7NsQkBOiUQ">Bitcoin.com</a>. Ver is noted&nbsp;as both an outspoken evangelist for the technology and one of the first 'bitcoin millionaires'.</em></p>
			<p><em>In the first entry in CoinDesk's "<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/category/the-milestones-bitcoins-biggest-turning-points/">Bitcoin Milestones</a>"&nbsp;series, Ver discusses his initial brush with the technology and recounts the watershed moment when a single bitcoin became more valuable than the US dollar.</em></p>
			<p>I first heard the word 'bitcoin' in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">FreeTalkLive.com</span> podcast.</p>
			<p>It sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, <em>"This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn't worth anything."</em></p>
			<p>I moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research...</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
			<p>In February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around&nbsp;$0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture.</p>
			<p>I began to understand that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The supply of bitcoin is limited</li>
			<li>They could be sent anywhere in the world for free (no longer true)</li>
			<li>They could be sent anywhere nearly instantly (no longer true)</li>
			<li>They could be used almost anonymously (less true than we thought)</li>
			<li>It was impossible for governments to stop.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That's when the dots (helped by years of studying Marx and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises" target="_blank">Mises</a>) connected in my mind.</p>
			<p>I realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days.</p>
			<p>There was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option&nbsp;for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox.</p>
			<p>I contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site's owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn't yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York.</p>
			<p>I waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox... and the price of bitcoin rose... and then it rose some more...</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
			<p>Several days went by, but Gox still hadn't credited my wire transfer.</p>
			<p>I began to grow impatient... The price was rising ever closer to $1.</p>
			<p>As the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited... but I wasn't deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well â€“ and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin.</p>
			<p>One of them was less than convinced.</p>
			<p>When I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, "If you think bitcoins are so great, why don't you buy more of them?"</p>
			<p>As soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox.</p>
			<p>Somewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1...</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
			<p>As anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem.</p>
			<p>I couldn't help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better.</p>
			<p>I would literally tell anyone who would listen.</p>
			<p>From strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!)</p>
			<p>I paid for the world's first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became.</p>
			<p>I knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea.</p>
			<p>But, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time.</p>
			<p>I still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies.</p>
			<p>They were all wrong, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfydIbhduu0">I gladly told them so</a>.</p>
			<p>Today, many people still dismiss bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the winning cryptocurrency in the end. But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.</p>
